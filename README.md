# Zcode compiler

## Introduction

At Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, we computer science students have a required course called
"Principles of programming languages" (or PPL for short). This course teaches us about programming
language design and implementations. In this course, we are required to write a simple compiler for
a simple, JVM-based programming language named 'Zcode'.

The implementation process is divided into 4 phases corresponding to to 4 assignments:

 - Scanning, Parsing: In this phase, we are required to write a parser to check if syntax of the
   input program is valid.

 - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation: Create the abstract syntax tree from the parse tree
   generated by the parser.

 - Static checking: Using the generated AST, detect semantic errors occurred in the program.

 - Code generation: The compiler uses the AST to generate JVM bytecodes.

This repository is used to store assignment details and my solution of each assignment.

## Requirements

Python 3

## How to run

Download ANTLR v4.9.2 and put it in the project directory: https://www.antlr.org/download.html

### On Linux/Unix
    source ./install_pkg.sh # create virtual environment and install all required Python packages
    source ./init.sh        # initialize environment variables

### On Windows

## How to test
    cd src
    make test

I haven't built the CLI for this compiler yet, but I will do it soon! :)
