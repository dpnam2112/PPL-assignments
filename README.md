# PPL-assignments

## Introduction

In Ho Chi Minh University of Technology, we computer science students have a required course called
"Principles of programming languages" (or PPL for short). This course teaches us about programming
language design and implementations. In this course, we are required to write a simple compiler for
a simple, JVM-based programming language named 'Zcode'.

The implementation process is divided into 4 phases associated to 4 assignments:

 - Scanning, Parsing: In this phase, we are required to write a parser to check if syntax of the
   input program is valid.

 - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation: Create the abstract syntax tree from the parse tree
   generated by the parser.

 - Static checking: Using the generated AST, detect semantic errors occurred in the program.

 - Code generation: The compiler uses the AST to generate JVM bytecodes.

This repository is used to store assignment details and my solution of each assignment.

## How to test
    `cd src`

    `make test`
